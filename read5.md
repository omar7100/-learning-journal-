## the colors in CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using an external CSS file
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content)

An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

*With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!*
