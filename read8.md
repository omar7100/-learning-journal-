 ### a computer is any device capable of performing mathematical equations or calculations.
 Almost all the computers that average people interact with today are *microcomputers*. The term is somewhat old-fashioned and not commonly used in advertising or industry literature.
 
 ## The motherboard

 The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.

 The central processing unit **(CPU)**, also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click the mouse, or start an application, you're sending instructions to the CPU.

 **RAM** is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.

 The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
 ## A binary code
 A binary code represents text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a two-symbol system. The two-symbol system used is often "0" and "1" from the binary number system. The binary code assigns a pattern of binary digits, also known as bits, to each character, instruction, etc. For example, a binary string of eight bits can represent any of 256 possible values and can, therefore, represent a wide variety of different items.
