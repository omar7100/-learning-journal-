### JavaScript 
## is a **programming** language that can be included on web pages to make them more interactive. You can use it to check or modify the contents of forms, change images, open new windows and write dynamic page content.
 
 *script* is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal ,
  To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task .
 JavaScript contains many *mathematical_operators*,
  which we can use with numbers. 

 ***The Java String concat()*** method concatenates one string to the end of another string.
 This method returns a string with the value of the string passed into the method, appended to the end of the string. + operator is used to concatenate strings on either side.

 A function is a *self_contained* piece of code that returns a value.
  You can use JavaScript's built-in functions, or create your own.
 As with any programming language, JavaScript variables are a like a container that contains a value â€” a value that can be changed as required.
